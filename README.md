# Topic-Modeling-on-Movie-Scripts
This project is about applying topic modeling algorithms on movie scripts written by Christopher Nolan

- I have created the dataset by downloading the scripts from https://www.scriptslug.com/scripts/writer/christopher-nolan
- The python notebook contains all steps from preprocessing, analysis and applying topic modeling algorithms like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Non-Negative Matrix Factorisation (NMF) and Biterm (BTM).
- I have also included performance evaluation metrics like Coherence scores, jaccard similarity and perplexity.
